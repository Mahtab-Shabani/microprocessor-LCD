# Project Display Using Microprocessor

This project demonstrates how to interface an LCD with an 8051 microcontroller. A program is written to control the LCD which can display messages of our choice.

## Features
- It uses an 8051 microcontroller to drive an LCD
- It displays text messages on the LCD screen
- Implements basic structure for LCD control and initialization functions

## How It Works
The microcontroller initializes the LCD and sends text commands to the Microcontroller, displaying the characters in the given space. The code includes functions for LCD initialization, writing data, and clearing the screen.
